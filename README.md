## Microfrontends with Vanilla JS

- This is a very basic implementation of microfrontends using vanilla JS and webpack. The container app mounts both the products and cart apps within it.
- Both the product and cart apps can be run standalone, by themselves.
- For local development of the container app, it needs itself, the products and the cart app to be running.
- `npm run start` in each micro front end will boot the app with `webpack serve`
